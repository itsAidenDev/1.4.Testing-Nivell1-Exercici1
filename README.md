# 1.4. Testing (Level 1 - Exercise 1)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java project solves the following exercise:

"Create a Java class that manages a collection of books in a library. The class must allow adding books, retrieving the list of books, getting a specific book by position, adding a book at a specific position, and removing a book by title.

It implements the following functionalities:

- The class must allow books to be added to the collection.
- It should be possible to retrieve the complete list of books
- You should be able to get the title of a book given a position.
- It should be possible to add a book in a specific position.
- It should be possible to delete a book by title.

Verify its correct operation with JUnit:

- They verify that the list of books is not null after creating a new object.
- They confirm that the list is an expected size after inserting several books.
- They ensure that the list contains a specific book in its correct position.
- They verify that there are no duplicate book titles in the list.
- They check that the title of a book can be retrieved given a specific position.
- They ensure that adding a book modifies the list correctly.
- They confirm that removing a book decreases the size of the list.
- They verify that the list remains alphabetical after adding or removing a book".

The goal is to **develop skills in object-oriented programming (OOP), collection management**, and **unit testing** in Java. It focuses on designing a class that models a real-world system (a library) and ensures its functionality through thorough testing with JUnit.
